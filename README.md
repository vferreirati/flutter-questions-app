# Flutter Questions App

This is a simple project of mine which implements a simple yet robust question answering app. 
The idea behind this app is to have a basic project open to the public with basic functionalities. This same code base will be improved upon and used later on a more advanced (and private) application that will be published on Android and IOS stores.

## Planned functionalities and implementation details:
- View and Business logic separation using BLoC pattern. This will include the usage of repositories and local cache using databases.
- Question answering functionality using mock data (Real world data will be used later, in the private app ofc...)
- Data filtering (Still not sure if this will be part of this project).
- A few more stuff that i can't think of right now.

I know that a project like this can be a bit weird, since most of the functionality will no be present on this version, but i've been noticing that most of my projects are private. This is not a good idea since i need some "proof of knowledge" to be public on my github profile. Also, this way i can give back something to the community, maybe someone can learn a thing or two about the way flutter works, who knows?
